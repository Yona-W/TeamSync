This is a crazy idea I had at some point. I ended up going through with it and making it into a gamemode. **So, what is it?**

This is a brand new chaotic gamemode, even more chaotic than URF or One For All. Using a program I wrote, all (well, most) keypresses are synchronized across players. It's as if everyone were playing on the same keyboard.

Prepare for epic 5-man useless flashes, wasted heals, epicly bad ults and skillshots going the wrong way. Also, don't forget to buy mana regen. Just a tip.

So, how do I play it?

___

1. Download [this](https://github.com/jmontineri/TeamSync/releases/). It's the program that actually does all the magic. You're probably thinking this is a virus: it's not, the program is [open-source](https://github.com/jmontineri/TeamSync) so ask someone who knows C# if you don't trust me. The server side is an unmodified Photon Server, if you don't trust me there either you can set up your own. Antivirus programs might think it's a keylogger because it acts as one to intercept keypresses.

2. Login to LoL. You don't want other people potentially knowing your password.

3. Invite a bunch of people to play a custom game (or ranked 5's, if you're feeling ballsy).

4. Run TeamSync.exe. Choose the server (default should work), the room (default won't work) and click "Connect to server". Connecting might not work if there are over 100 players on my server, in that case either setup your own (Google it, "Set up Photon server" should give you enough results) or wait a short while.

5. You should see this:

      Status shanged: Connect

      Operation response: (255)

      My Player ID is: #

      This means you're connected. Tell your teammates your room name and have them connect as well.

6. Start the game. Everyone should use default keybindings with everything on smartcast without range indicators. Have fun!

__Don't forget to close TeamSync after you're done playing, you don't want to keep broadcasting your keypresses.__

**NOTE**: If everybody doesn't have the same keyboard layout, there will be bugs. Make sure everybody has identical (or at least similar) layouts.

**BLOCKED KEYS**: Windows, Control, PrintScreen, Escape, P, C, Tab, Alt

Tips: 

- Either play manaless champs or buy loads of mana regen. Spells get spammed a lot.
- Play champs with skillshots for maximum derpiness
- Chat is synced as well. Confuse your opponent in all-chat!
- Have your team and the enemy team in the same room for maximum ultimate chaos.
- Voice-Chat. Text chat is unusable and unfun. Voice chat? Soo much better. "WHO THE HELL FLASHED? STOP PRESSING B!"

Disclaimer: I can't be held responsible for any damage you do using this. As long as you follow the instructions, there isn't any risk of anything bad happening, but it is a program that broadcasts keypresses and as such leaving it running while typing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card info is a very, very bad idea.
